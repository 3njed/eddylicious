Common notation
===============

Here we define the notation for several important physical quantities.

   * :math:`U_0` --- the freestream streamwise velocity.

   * :math:`u_\tau` --- the friction velocity.

   * :math:`\nu` --- kinematic viscosity.

   * :math:`\delta_\nu` --- the viscous lengthscale, computed as
     :math:`\nu/u_\tau`.

   * :math:`c_f` --- the skin friction coefficient.

   * Measures of the thickness of a boundary layer.
      * :math:`\delta_{99}` --- the location where the mean velocity is equal
        to :math:`0.99U_0`.

      * :math:`\delta_*` --- the displacement thickness.

      * :math:`\theta` --- the momentum thickness.
   * The velocity field.
        :math:`u, \: v, \: w` --- the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise
        components of the velocity field.

      * :math:`U, \: V, \: W` --- the mean streamwise, wall-normal, and
        spanwise components of the velocity field.

      * :math:`u', \: v', \: w'` --- the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise
        components of the fluctuations of the velocity field.

   * Spatial coordinates.

      * :math:`x, \: y, \:, z` --- axes aligned with the streamwise,
        wall-normal, and spanwise directions.

      * :math:`\eta` --- the wall normal coordinate scaled with the 'outer
        scale', commonly :math:`\delta_{99}`.

      * :math:`y^+` --- the wall normal coordinate scaled with the viscous
        lengthscale :math:`\delta_\nu`.
