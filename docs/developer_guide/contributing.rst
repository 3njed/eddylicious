Contributing
============

Your contributions to the project are most welocome!
The best way to precede is open an issue on Bitbucket where you can describe
the contribution you have in mind.
However, in order to ensure that the overall quality of the library is
maintained, the following requirements have to be fulfilled for the
contribution to be accepted:

    * The code has to adhere to the existing style guidelines.
    * The new functionality has to be covered by unit-tests.
    * The new functionality has to be properly documented. This includes
      docstrings and contributions to the relevant parts of the User guide.
    * Ideally, a tutorial showcasing the usage of the new functionality should
      be provided.
