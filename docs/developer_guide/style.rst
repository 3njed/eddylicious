Code and documentation style
============================

Please use the following guidelines when extending eddylicious.

   * The suggestions in `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
     should be followed except for the variable name-style convention.

   * Variables should be named using the ``mixedCase`` style.

   * Docstrings should be written using the `Numpy docstring standard
     <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_
     .
     Examples are available `here
     <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`_.

   * In the restructuredText files used for documentation, three spaces are
     used for indenting.
