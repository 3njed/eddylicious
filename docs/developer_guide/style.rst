Code and documentation style
============================

Please use the following guidelines when extending eddylicious.

    * The suggestions in `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_
      should be followed except for the variable name-style convention.

    * Variables should use named using the ``mixedCase`` style.

    * Docstrings should be written using the `Numpy docstring standard
      <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_
      .
      Examples are available `here
      <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html>`_.
