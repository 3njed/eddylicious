eddylicious
===========

Eddylicious is a python library for generating inflow boundary fields for
Large Eddy simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of
turbulent flows.

The goal of eddylicious is to serve as a central place-holder for existing
inflow generation methods and make them easily accessible to the CFD community.

This web-page is intended as a documentation-hub for the library.
This includes a user guide and tutorials, contribution guidelines for
developers, and source-code documentation.
