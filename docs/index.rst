eddylicious
===========

Eddylicious is a python library for generating inflow boundary fields for
Large Eddy simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of
turbulent flows.

The goal of eddylicious is to serve as a central place-holder for existing
inflow generation methods an make them easily assessable to the CFD community.
The flow fields generated by eddylicious are saved to disk.
This allows the library to be solver-agnostic.
Support for a solver can easily be added by implementing an output format
that the solver can use to read in the boundary data.
