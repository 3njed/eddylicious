Eddylicious
===========

Eddylicious is a python library for generating inflow boundary fields for scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flow like LES and DNS.
The goal of eddylicious is to serve as a central place-holder for existing inflow generation methods and make them easily accessible to the CFD community.

Currently, eddylicious is geared mostly towards working with OpenFOAM, but we hope to support other CFD solvers in the future.
